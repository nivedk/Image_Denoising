## Please note

For any jupyter notebook contribution, please clear all output before you commit. Otherwise the images take up a lot of space, making the repository unnecessarily large.

#### Note: Best working code (perceptual loss) and results can be found in [/perceptual_loss/v2](https://github.com/nivedk/Image_Denoising/tree/master/perceptual_loss/v2)
